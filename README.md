# Phoenix
### Phoenix is an authentication toolbox.
The toolbox is for distinuguishing between the fake and real nodes in an IoT netowork. Real nodes are the nodes that have physical presence in the network. Fake nodes could be virtual nodes that do not have physical appearance in the netowrk.
We have tested the toolbox particularly in this release for drones data (telemetry). But the implementation can be extended to any nonlinear dynamic system.
